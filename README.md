# Training-Institute-Project
To use this project first of all you have to build the database to store the data,
To help you out with this I have also mentioned the fiele of SQL queries named, "training_institution.sql" , and "training_institution_QUERIES.sql".
The after building the database, download javaSpring, apache tomcat in your system and plug them with your IDE,
If you are using Eclipse ide you can download it from ide itself called Spring Tools Suite, and then run the project using tomcat and you are good to go.
